# Teensy3.6-example
Kicad files to make a custom Teensy 3.5 or 3.6, based on the official Teensy schematics, but exposing all pins for testing. Does not route the second USB port and the SD. Using the commonly available LM1117-3.3 for voltage and a cheap USB Type C receptacle rather than USB Micro connector. Don't forget that you'll need to buyt the MKL02Z32VFG4 from PJRC for this to work.

Note: The PCB is my first BGA layout, so you might want to route this differently.
