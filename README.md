# Teensy3.6-example
Kicad files to make a custom Teensy 3.5 or 3.6, based on the official Teensy schematics, but exposing all pins for testing. Does not route the second USB port and the SD. Using the commonly available LM1117-3.3 for voltage and a cheap USB Type C receptacle rather than USB Micro connector. Don't forget that you'll need to buy the MKL02Z32VFG4 from PJRC for this to work.

I'll update this repo with pictures once I get the board back from fab.

Note: The PCB is my first BGA layout, so you might want to route this differently.
